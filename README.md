## Loom files for scRNA-seq data visualization
As a resource to community we provide 3 Loom files that contain UMAP-clustering, cluster annotation and gene expression from: 

**1.** The scRNA-seq datasets sequenced on this study (Day 30 of ASECRiAV conversion and naive and primed human pluripotent stem cells).

**2.** The scRNA-seq datasets sequenced on this study (time course of ASECRiAV conversion (day 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 13 and 18) and day 70 sorted extraembryonic stem cells).

**3.** Integration of initial sequencing, time course and human embryo data sets [Messmer et al., 2019](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(18)32074-6.pdf), [Petropoulos et al., 2016](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)30280-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS009286741630280X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), [Zhou et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1500-0), [Xiang et al., 2020](https://www-nature-com.kuleuven.e-bronnen.be/articles/s41586-019-1875-y) and [Tyser et al., 2021](https://www-nature-com.kuleuven.e-bronnen.be/articles/s41586-021-04158-y).

You can browse interactively these two loom files using [SCope platform/PRC2](https://scope.aertslab.org/#/HumanPluripotencyPRC2/*/welcome), click on the arrow found on the left of the screen under DATASETS > Session Looms > Uncategorized, and select the non-integrated dataset or the human embryo integrated dataset to display and browse.

Loom files can be downloaded here: [GSE191286](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE191286) using the http links at the bottom of the page. You can browse interactively using [SCope platform](https://scope.aertslab.org/#/0e367043-465c-442d-8b64-4af393567818/*/welcome). In order to browse the datasets, upload loom files by clicking on "Upload new dataset" in the menu on the left-side of SCope website. Uploading may take a few minutes. Successful upload will activate a private, temporary session for the user. Each session expires after 5 days, but can be renewed by re-uploading the loom file. 

Standalone SCope apps for macOS and Linux can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/aertslab/SCope/releases).

SCope was developed and is maintained by [Aerts lab](https://www.aertslab.org/).
